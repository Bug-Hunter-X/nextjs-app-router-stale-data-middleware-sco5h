To fix this, ensure that data fetching is tied directly to the component's rendering lifecycle.  Using features like `use` within the layout or page, combined with appropriate state management, allows you to guarantee that data is always fetched before being used.  Avoid relying on middleware to hold state across route transitions; instead, fetch data only when the component needs it.
