This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using middleware and dynamic routes.  The bug involves stale data persisting across route transitions, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution illustrates how to correctly handle data fetching and component re-rendering to prevent this issue.  The `staleDataBug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `staleDataSolution.js` presents the corrected implementation.
